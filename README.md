# Security-System
## Overview
The Security Cameras Object Detection Project aims to notify the building owner when specific objects (to be determined by the owner) enter a defined restricted area, which is customizable by the owner. This system utilizes multiple cameras to monitor various areas and sends real-time notifications to the owner via email when a restricted object is detected within a specific area.

## Project Goals
- Implement object detection algorithms to identify specific objects within defined restricted areas.
- Develop a system that manages over 60 cameras efficiently, each with its unique restricted area.
- Automatically send email notifications to the building owner with the camera's position and an image of the detected object within the restricted area.

## Features
- Object detection using [mention algorithms or libraries used].
- Real-time monitoring and notification system.
- Customizable restricted areas for each camera.
- Parallel programming techniques to ensure efficient performance.
